## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[An API is basically a set of rules one application has to go through to interact with another application, it's significance is important because it makes the job of a developer easier so that there data can be shared through multiple platforms.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[An interface is aa defined method of communication between entities, while an API is specialised for software to software interaction within a system.]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[Endpoint- the path where API-functions are accessed, Methods- define the type of command being executed, Data Formats- shows the data being shared in API-functions. I find web API's the most interesting because through learning about them i've seen how many apps use the exact same systems as the most popular apps like eg.(spotify, whatsaap and instagram).]

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[Libraries]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[For me watching youtube tutorials help me to make a concept easier to understand and also doing practical examples.]
